This is the official repository that contains most of the standard documentation regarding programming around the Orbiting platform.

## API Documentation

If you're looking for a way to interface with Orbiting without one of our libraries then you should [read this](docs/api.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are looking to development separately on a library to the Orbiting development team, please [make sure it's not in the road map](ROADMAP.md). If you're unsure please check ask in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/sg8jHb2cU7).

## Roadmap

For more information on what we're currently working on and what's planned please check out [our roadmap here](ROADMAP.md).
